"""
This file in its present state reads a video stream from camera 0
and attempts to find eyes in the image using eye_detect.py.
Dependencies:
- OpenCV python bindings (cv2)
- dlib python bindings (NOTE: dlib does not yet support python 3.8, use 3.7)
- Adrian Rosebrock's imutils package

Other considerations:
- dlib facial feature detection is slow, so this script has a very low framerate.
